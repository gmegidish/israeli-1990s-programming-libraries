# Israeli 1990s Programming Libraries

This is a placeholder. I still don't know what I'm going to do with this repo.

I was just running through old cds, getting them backed up and moved to a dropbox, and I realized I have 
collected a huge archive of programming libraries and tutorials during the BBS era. Some of these files
were written by Israelis and everybody long forgot about them. 

I will started uploading files that I have, and if you have other files, please upload them as well. All versions
you have, not only the latest.

We'll see where this repo goes :)
